# CSharpPlayersGuide5thEdition
Projects I completed while working through the C# Player's Guide by RB Whitaker. Highly Recommend this book to anyone learning to code with C#. Ask me about the coolest projects I made. They are all created from a provided problem sheets in the book, so people often have different solutions.
